During my PhD I worked on a challenge puzzle game called Charge, and during the COVID pandemic of 2020 I finally had time to polish the project and officially publish it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1367680/Charge/">Steam</a>.

This was mostly intended to be a fun experiment in puzzle game design, but rapidly expanded into a much larger project involving art, special effects, sound, music, translation, localization, QA, marketing, analytics, and all the other fun challenges inherent in designing and deploying games.
