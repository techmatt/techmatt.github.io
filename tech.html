<h1>Technology Transfers</h1>

I've helped developed a lot of different technology that has shipped across a wide range of Adobe products.

		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwfGtS3fjm8">Mind Blowing Text to Vector in Adobe Illustrator!</a></p>
		<p>I worked on a new generative AI technology to create vector graphics artwork from a text description. This work is part of a broad effort to model very difficult distributions, such as the space of beautiful images, and recent successes here have created powerful technology Adobe is working to apply across many different domains. This powerful tool creates segmented vector artwork from your text prompt. A lot of geometric work goes into ensuring that the resulting vectors are not just a flat set of tens of thousands of paths, but instead we try to generate segmented, editable geometric reporesentations that can be more easily manipulated by artists.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjzHLdTFO48">A.I. is Finally in Adobe Illustrator! - Generative Recolor</a></p>
		<p>This generative model lets you recolor your artwork using only a text prompt as guidance. This relies upon previous image-based recoloring technology we had designed, and makes it very quick and easy to try out new coloring ideas.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT1N_72rjKc">Identify Fonts using Retype (Beta) in Illustrator</a></p>
		<p>Editing text within Illustrator is easy, but frequently you encounter either a rasterized image or an "outlined" font that is just a collection of Beziers and has lots its original connection to the underlying font. the Retype feature can detect the underlying font and let you easily edit the text. It even recreates text-on-path effects, for text that is not just a single line of characters.</p>

		<p>This is an ongoing research project into directly generating vector graphics from image or text-based conditoning. Font glyphs are an excellent example of a regular structure that we can learn the patterns of to help create new glyphs that match the input image style.</p>

		<p>Tracing, coloring, and shading vector artwork can be a very exacting and time-consuming process. Project Sunshine jump starts this process by helping artists to add vibrant colors and shading to their artwork. Artists can select a character or object and Project Sunshine will use machine learning to understand what the artwork represents and suggest many different ways to color it. Project Sunshine can also help bring shadows and highlights to artwork while letting the artist experiment with lighting from multiple directions.</p>

		<div class = "pubConference">Illustrator 2022</div>
		<p>We added powerful 3D raytracing features to Illustrator. I helped write the Monte Carlo denoiser, based off our SIGGRAPH 2021 paper <a href="https://www.mustafaisik.net/anf/">Interactive Monte Carlo Denoising using Affinity of Neural Features</a>.</p>

		<div class = "pubConference">Illustrator for iPad 2022</div>
		<p>This technology takes your sketches, photographs, or other artwork and converts it into vector graphics. I trained a series of deep learning
		models that help the vectorize engine understand what parts of sketches to focus on, which lets it ignore aspects like shadows, smudges, grid lines, and other artifacts.</p>
