<h1>Technology</h1>

I've developed several tools that have shipped in many Adobe products.

<div class="rTable">

<div class="rTableRow">
	<div class="rTableCellA">
		<img src="thumbnails/diffusionGradients.png" />
	</div>
	<div class="rTableCellB">
		<div class = "pubName"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxlMBU5acv0">Illustrator CC: Freeform Gradients</a></div>
		<div class = "pubConference">Sneak Peek 2018</div>
		<p>The freeform gradients tool naturally lets you control the diffusion of colors across your vector graphics and is one of many ways we are looking into making the Gradient Mesh tool easier and faster to use.</p>

<div class="rTableRow">
	<div class="rTableCellA">
		<img src="thumbnails/vectorPuppetWarp.png" />
	</div>
	<div class="rTableCellB">
		<div class = "pubName"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC41fm_huYY">Vector Puppet Warp</a></div>
		<div class = "pubConference">Illustrator CC 2017</div>
		<p>Puppet Warp lets you twist and distort parts of your artwork, such that the transformations appear natural. You can add, move, and rotate pins to seamlessly transform your artwork into different variations using the Puppet Warp tool in Illustrator.</p>

<div class="rTableRow">
	<div class="rTableCellA">
		<img src="thumbnails/matchCameraPerspective.png" />
	</div>
	<div class="rTableCellB">
		<div class = "pubName"><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/dimension/features.html">Automated Image Matching</a></div>
		<div class = "pubConference">Dimension CC 2017</div>
		<p>Using deep learning, we can automatically estimate the perspective a photograph was taken from, making it much easier to composite 3D content into those scenes. This is an application of our CVPR 2017 paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01259">Deep Single Image Camera Calibration</a>.</p>
